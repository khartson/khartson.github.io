I am a software engineer from Cleveland, Ohio. I am currenly working as a software at Root Integrated Systems, designing and commissioning network-based AV systems.

My background consists of a bachelor's degree in Chinese from Tufts University in Boston. After graduation, I sought to venture into the tech world by attending Flatiron School's intensive 60-week software engineering bootcamp, where I specialized in a stack of Ruby on Rails and React for web development. I began programming before graduating Tufts by taking a self-paced Python course, as well as intro and data structures courses taught in C++. Professionally, I began my career shadowing the backend team at Findaway, now the audiobooks in division of Spotify. In early 2023, I entered a level I service desk position at Flynn Restaurant Group, performing troubleshooting for both corporate and franchise employees and locations. 

My primary development interests consist of web services and APIs, but I have more recently sought to expand my knowledge of systems and integration programming by learning C# for native Windows development, a journey I will document here. I also wish to expand into the realm of enterprise data management, which includes databasing tools and developing processes to streamline data pipelines. I hope to use this blog to document my growing skillset as a developer!
